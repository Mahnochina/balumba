            <p>VAZ trademark of the family of cars of the Volga Automobile Plant, assigned to the VAZ-2101 model in June
                1970.
                The first Zhiguli model was based on a modified Italian Fiat 124 model.[1] Cars of the
                VAZ-2101/2102/2103
                family
                were sold under the trade name "Zhiguli" on the domestic and international markets (except for several
                European
                countries, where the word "Zhiguli" was associated by buyers with the dubious word gigolo, as well as in
                Hungary,
                where it generally coincided with the obscene in a word). Therefore, on the foreign market, the Zhiguli
                trademark
                was quickly replaced by LADA.
